# TSI Group Project

## Project Introduction
Our product is Tubluar, a streamlined console-based application designed to optimise the holiday experience. By offering a seamless platform for renting or purchasing beach essentials directly from the command line, Tubular eliminates the need to navigate multiple applications, simplifying the process for users. Our innovative click-and-collect system ensures that customers can effortlessly pick up their orders right at the beachfront, enhancing convenience and enjoyment.

In addition, Tubular features an intuitive owner view, empowering shop owners with comprehensive tools to manage their inventory, track order details, and be prepared for customer collection times. Holidays are a time to de-stress; with Tubular, customers and staff are given an easy and efficient experience! 


## Project Architecture


## Retrospective
### Issues identified in the retro:
- We need a clearer definition of when to accept PRs
- Clearer communication is needed with respect to approval of PRs
- Clearer communication is needed for approached implementation especially with overlapping/continuous work
- We should ensure work is spread across the sprint (burn down chart)
- Create uniformity across implementations in term of variables etc.

### Actions
- Implementing a stand up will address multiple issues raised. In the stand up, each team member will have the opportunity to voice that they have raised a PR, or reviewed a PR. Additionally, by raising which tickets we are working on in stand up, we should minimise any duplicated work.
- By highlighting our availability in stand up, or communicating if we are struggling with work, we will be better able to spread our work across the sprint. 
- We will also look to implement a burndown chart, to identify our rate of ticket completion compared to the estimations. 
- PRs can be merged after 2 reviewers have approved it and all comments have been addressed.
